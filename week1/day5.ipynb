      "Yesterday we merged a PR deprecating TensorFlow and Flax support in transformers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward, we're focusing all our efforts on PyTorch to remove a lot of the bloating in the transformers library. Expect a simpler toolkit, across the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a decision we take lightly: multi-backend has been a big selling point of transformers over the years. However, we have seen our user base consolidate in PyTorch.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will keep support of TF and Flax with v4 as LTS (~mid 2026). This change marks the beginning of v5!\n",
      "\n",
      "We have heard the feedback about transformers being bloated with many layers of abstraction. \n",
      "\n",
      "With this, we expect to remove 50% of the code from the library. This will contribute to removing abstraction layers; aligned with our focus on simplification:\n",
      "https://lnkd.in/eRMMj_fm\n",
      "If you're still interested in running in Jax/TF/Keras, stay tuned, we're working with tools like MaxText/MaxDiffusion/Keras 3 to see how to use the transformers model definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll aim to continue having maximum compatibility with that ecosystem, even if outside of PyTorch.\n",
